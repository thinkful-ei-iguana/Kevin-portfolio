            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, Im Kevin.  Iâ€™m a fullstack web developer based out of Atlanta, GA.  Trying to understand how things work has always fascinated me.  
                    That fascination has driven me from a kid who spent countless hours playing with LEGOs to graduate studies in 
                    psychology and clinical social work.  I always found myself spending much of my free time at my computer despite 
                    knowing very little about how it worked.  In a past life I worked to help people understand how they work in the context of their 
                    own lives as an individual and family therapist.  That line of work taught me two important things.  The first was to never 
                    underestimate the value of taking a collaborative approach to solving problems.  Second was the power of perception and how 
                    dramatically that impacts what we (think) we can and can't do.  Now I tackle projects that use technology to help people thrive 
                    and engage with the world in ways that empower them to do things they may not have tried before.  Seeing a project come together 
                    always feels like magic to me.  You can check out some of my work below.</p>
